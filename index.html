                        <summary>Information Technology Services Student Intern</summary>
                        <hr>
                        &emsp;I took this position initially as a winter internship
                        during my school break in 2020. However as the time for
                        it to end came near they offered to have it extend until
                        I graduated in 2022. This position was primarily to introduce
                        me to an actual work environment as well as the technologies,
                        techniques, and time management skill to work both in the
                        office and as a remote worker.<br>
                        &emsp;I worked by myself with daily meetings with my boss
                        to go over what progress I had made and my thoughts on
                        what I would work on that day and how I would approach
                        it. I also had both weekly and bi-weekly meetings with
                        other teams to schedule upcoming projects that we believed
                        could be done in 2 weeks as well as report how we were
                        doing on our projects which were managed using a website
                        called Asana.<br>
                        &emsp;Most of my projects were creating forms for mainly
                        faculty to submit to request funding from the school or
                        to fix bugs that had appeared on other forms and were
                        reported to our department. Storing the information collected
                        in the forms was primarily done through SQL while the forms
                        themselves were created using CFML, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br>
                        &emsp;A significant project that I did in this position
                        would be the complete reconstruction of the Hamilton College
                        Dining Menu section of their college application available
                        through the apple and android app store. Using AJAX I did
                        a POST call to Bon Appetit's API that returned an enormous
                        JSON object that I verified and stored using JS and SQL.
                        I then would parse that data and display menus for multiple
                        dining halls each with multiple meal times in both mobile and 
                        desktop friendly layouts as well as providing a way for
                        people to look at prior and future menus.<br><br>

                        <summary>Software Developer Intern</summary>
                        <hr>
                        &emsp;This job was to fulfill a request from my high school that I had graduated from 
                        to attempt to bring the act score of their current students up as it had been decreasing 
                        over the years.<br>
                        &emsp;It was written entirely in Python and was a collection of flashcard style questions 
                        that required the student to get a passing grade of them correct before they could finish. It 
                        would then give a PDF report to the student of their results ordered by what questions they 
                        missed most often in descending order. The questions were held in a seperate file in a JSON 
                        object that enabled the teacher overseeing the review could edit the questions and rearrange the answers.<br>
                        &emsp;At this position I was able to gain experience with working with people who were not familiar 
                        with computers let alone programming but had a goal they wished to accomplish. I also in this position 
                        was able to experience creating a product from design and development to release as well as 
                        presentation of the project to possible users.<br>

                    <p>
                        &emsp;I am from a small countryside town in the middle of Oklahoma where the only 
                        things to do were work outside, sports, or sleep. I however took to the indoors usually. 
                        I was always interested in computers and soon spent all my time playing around with 
                        BASH on my families one Windows VISTA computer that all 5 of us shared. I knew 
                        immediately that I wanted to work with computers in some capacity when I was older 
                        so I did my best and was able to graduate Bristow High School with a full scholarship 
                        from QuestBridge to attend Hamilton College. <br>
                        &emsp;It was there at Hamilton College that I learned more about Computer Science 
                        and was able to greatly expand my knowledge about no only theory, space and time complexity, 
                        and algorithms but about people as Hamilton College attract people from all across the 
                        world. It was also here that I was able to get my first experience working in an actual 
                        office setting with computers helping people from multiple departments to solve problems 
                        and make their lives easier.<br>
                        &emsp;With that experience and a degree from Hamilton. I am now out in the real 
                        world looking for where I can continue learning more about my passion, help 
                        others solve their problems, and have new and exciting adventures.</p>

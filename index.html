                        <p>Hello! I am a recent college graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science 
                            from Hamilton College. I have 2 years of web development experience and 
                            am hoping to find a company and a team that I can connect to that I am able 
                            to learn from and support.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">Information Technology Services Student Intern</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            I took this position initially as a winter internship during school break. However 
                            as the time for it to end came near they offered to have it extend until I graduated in 2022. 
                            This position was primarily to introduce me to an actual work environment as well as 
                            the technologies, techniques, and time management skill to work both in the office and
                            as a remote worker.

                            I worked by myself with daily meetings with my boss to go over what progress I had made 
                            and my thoughts on what I would work on that day and how I would approach it. I also 
                            had both weekly and biweekly meetings with other teams to schedule upcoming projects 
                            that we believed could be done in 2 weeks as well as report how we were doing on our projects 
                            which were managed using a website called Asana.

                            Most of my projects were creating forms for mainly faculty to submit to request funding from 
                            the school or to fix bugs that had appeared on other forms and were reported to our department. 
                            Storing the information collected in the forms was primarily done through SQL while the forms 
                            themselves were created using CFML, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

                            A significant project that I did in this position would be the complete reconstruction of the 
                            Hamilton College Dining Menu section of their college application available through the 
                            apple and android app store. Using AJAX I did a POST call to Bon Appetit's API that returned 
                            an enourmos JSON object that I verified and stored using SQL. I then would parse that data 
                            and display menus for multiple dining halls each with multiple meal times in both mobile and 
                            desktop friendly layouts as well as providing a way for people to look at prior and future menus.

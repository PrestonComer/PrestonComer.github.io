                            from Hamilton College. I have 2 years of web development experience and 
                            am hoping to find a company and a team that I can connect to that I am able

                        <summary>Information Technology Services Student Intern</summary><br>
                        &emsp;I took this position initially as a winter internship during my school break in 2020. However 
                        as the time for it to end came near they offered to have it extend until I graduated in 2022. 
                        This position was primarily to introduce me to an actual work environment as well as 
                        the technologies, techniques, and time management skill to work both in the office and
                        as a remote worker.<br>
                        &emsp;I worked by myself with daily meetings with my boss to go over what progress I had made 
                        and my thoughts on what I would work on that day and how I would approach it. I also 
                        had both weekly and bi-weekly meetings with other teams to schedule upcoming projects 
                        that we believed could be done in 2 weeks as well as report how we were doing on our projects 
                        which were managed using a website called Asana.<br>
                        &emsp;Most of my projects were creating forms for mainly faculty to submit to request funding from 
                        the school or to fix bugs that had appeared on other forms and were reported to our department. 
                        Storing the information collected in the forms was primarily done through SQL while the forms 
                        themselves were created using CFML, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br>
                        &emsp;A significant project that I did in this position would be the complete reconstruction of the 
                        Hamilton College Dining Menu section of their college application available through the 
                        apple and android app store. Using AJAX I did a POST call to Bon Appetit's API that returned 
                        an enormous JSON object that I verified and stored using SQL. I then would parse that data 
                        and display menus for multiple dining halls each with multiple meal times in both mobile and 
                        desktop friendly layouts as well as providing a way for people to look at prior and future menus.<br><br>

                        <summary>Software Developer Intern</summary>
                        &emsp;This job was to fulfill a request from my high school that I had graduated from 
                        to attempt to bring the act score of their current students up as it had been decreasing 
                        over the years.<br>
                        &emsp;It was written entirely in Python and was a collection of flashcard style questions 
                        that required the student to get a passing grade of them correct before they could finish. It 
                        would then give a PDF report to the student of their results ordered by what questions they 
                        missed most often in descending order. The questions were held in a seperate file in a JSON 
                        object that enabled the teacher overseeing the review could edit the questions and rearrange the answers.<br><br>

                        <li>
                            How often is it recommended to backup data? I would 
                            think that it would vary depending on the amount of 
                            data and how expensive it is to backup, store, and restore.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            After rading 'the cybersecurity industry' section I 
                            am now thinking that how often you backup data would have
                            to do with the importanc of the data and how close to the 
                            user it is. For example, data that would be more common to 
                            be edited such as passwords, usernames, and purchase histories 
                            would ned to be backed up quite often while data like 
                            social security numbers or mailing address would only need 
                            to be backedup not even half as often.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Cybersecurity affects everybody including the 
                        government. It is not something that being big is a positive 
                        thing but is instead a problem as there are more possible 
                        vulnerabilities. There is more code that could be possibly 
                        exploited or more people to take advantage of. There is 
                        also the higher possibility of more important data being 
                        stolen as a result of bigger companies like Amazon 
                        collecting more data including but not limited to credit 
                        card information or previous purchases. The formal definition 
                        by CISCO of cybersecurity is "Cybersecurity is the practice 
                        of protecting systems, networks, and program from digital 
                        attacks."<br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;The <strong>CIA Triad</strong> stands for 
                        confidentiality, integrity, and availability and is the origin 
                        of nearly all security policies. <strong>Confidentiality</strong> 
                        refers to protecting private information from unauthorized 
                        eyes. Some ways to protect confidentiality is having 
                        different levels of access to different levels of data. 
                        For example, you might not want to give access to vital 
                        data to someone who is in a temporary role or was just 
                        hired. You could also encrypt the data so that it is not so 
                        easily accessed and read and/or you could require that 
                        someone identifies themself before having access to the 
                        data. <strong>Integrity</strong> is the idea that the 
                        data cannot be edited, deleted, or added without the 
                        consent of the relevant party. One way to prevent this 
                        is to secure who can access and change the data. Another 
                        way is to have backups of the data such that if someone 
                        does get in and modify the data then it can be restored.
                        <strong>Availability</strong> is the idea that the data 
                        should be available to the person to whom it belongs 
                        such as bank statements to the owners of the account. 
                        This increases the security because the data owner has 
                        the ability to manually confirm and notice any changes 
                        that they did not expect. For the company this means that 
                        there servers and networks need to be monitored and up 
                        so that they can be accessed.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Cybersecurity is constantly being expanded as 
                        the internet is introduced into different fields and objects. 
                        Cybersecurity encompasses many skills.<br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;<strong>Security Engineering</strong> is a category 
                        that includes <strong>Information Security (InfoSec)</strong> 
                        protects data in any form from being accessed, modified, 
                        shared, or deleted by the wrong people. <strong>Network Security</strong> 
                        regards the network infrastructure of an organization that 
                        guards against unauthorized access or data being intercepted. 
                        <strong>Application Security</strong> refers to techniques 
                        used to defend an application (both hardware and software) 
                        from attack they include but are not limited to secure coding, 
                        using antivirus, firewalls, and encryption. <strong>Cloud 
                        Security</strong> is making sure resources uploaded to the 
                        cloud are secure. <strong>Cryptography</strong> methods to 
                        hide and unhide information so that data is readable only 
                        by authorized people. <strong>Critical Infrastructure Security
                        </strong> is defending physical systems that are beecoming 
                        more digital like energy grids, hospitals, water, waste, 
                        schools, etc. This category includes not only human attacks 
                        but natural disasters.<br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;<strong>Governance And Compliance</strong> it is 
                        extremely important to be informed and to follow the laws 
                        and regulations put in place by the state, nation, and 
                        even international agencies. You must also be sure to 
                        audit your security to ensure that those policies are followed. 
                        This part of cybersecurity does not necessarily require 
                        programming information.<br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;<strong>Risk Management And Threat Intelligence</strong> 
                        there will always be a risk of someone getting past your security 
                        measures. You can manage that risk by identifying the risks, 
                        assessing the chance and severity of the risks, and finding 
                        the best ways to most efficiently address those risks. 
                        You should also attempt to identify the motivations behind 
                        the attacks, how severe the attacks might be, and the possible 
                        ways in which they might attack. Because of all this information 
                        it often overlaps with the data science field.<br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;<strong>Security Operations</strong> is the area 
                        responsible for creating security principles, monitoring 
                        incidents, and recovering from disasters. They can be seen 
                        as the people that actually do the above mentioned parts as 
                        well as creating documents and plans to explain the policy 
                        to other people.<br>

                        evolution of attack techniques. This can be seen in how the 
                        growth rate off malware infections has gone from 12.4 million 
                        in 2009 to 812.67 million in 2018 that is an increase of 800 
                        million in less than 10 years.<br>

                        &emsp;&emsp;<strong>Becoming familiar with standards and 
                        regulations: </strong> it is the companies responsibility 
                        to protect the data they collect. It is because of the trust 
                        that they are protecting our data that the people can be 
                        secure in there use of the internet to do sensitive transactions

                                More Programming Pearls (Confessions of a Coder) By Jon Bentley

                        <strong>Questions:</strong>
                        <ol class="questionList">
                            <li>
                                Are profilers supposed to be created by the coder 
                                specialized towards the current code or is there 
                                a specific one For each language?
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <strong>Thoughts: </strong>
                        Profilers seem to be incredibely useful and a great technique 
                        to employ for every program as long as you are able to 
                        identify the type of profiler that should be used for the 
                        specific program. However, that seems like it would be easy 
                        to do and if it is not difficult to make, find, or run a 
                        profiler that would fit your program then I can not think 
                        of a reason to not run all types of profilers. The one that 
                        I would run before any of the other would be a line profiler 
                        followed by a CPU profiler.

                            <li>
                                If you target the hardware and do not want to retrieve 
                                data but instead destroy it would it be easier to 
                                cause it to overloaded instead of targeting it physically?
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                If the easiest way to target information is to target 
                                the person then would it not be beneficial to put 
                                restrictions on who can hold positions where vital 
                                information is available. Would it also not be 
                                essential that there is an indepth instruction during 
                                our younger years? However even if that happens 
                                then it still does nothing to reduce the current 
                                vulnerabilities only future ones.

                        <strong>Thoughts: </strong>
                        I find it quite interesting that Cyber Security involves 
                        so much more than just the software and that the software 
                        is actually one of the harder parts to target. It is not 
                        really suprising to me to be honest. Personally if there 
                        was any way to target something it would be through an 
                        older person as representing yourself as something you are not.
                        It is also possible to target the hardware of the device. If 
                        you do this then I would think that it would be more difficult 
                        to have a sucessful attack but would be quite hard to solve the 
                        problem. I would also think that it would be easier to identify 
                        a device under attack and has the benefit that to take advantage 
                        of hardware you probably have to be able to come in contact 
                        with the hardware.
